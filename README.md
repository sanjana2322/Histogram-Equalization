**Exp-3 - Histogram-Equalization** = It is a powerful image processing technique used to enhance the contrast of an image. It works by adjusting the intensity distribution of the image to make it more uniform. To achieve this, histogram equalization first creates a histogram of the image, which is a graphical representation of the intensity distribution. The histogram shows the number of pixels at each intensity level, ranging from 0 to 255 for an 8-bit image. Next, the technique calculates the cumulative distribution function (CDF) by summing up the number of pixels at each intensity level and dividing by the total number of pixels. This gives the probability of each intensity level.The CDF values are then mapped to the intensity levels, creating a new intensity mapping function. This function is used to transform the original image. By applying the intensity mapping function to each pixel in the original image, histogram equalization produces a new image with a more uniform intensity distribution. Histogram equalization remains a widely used technique in various image processing applications, including medical imaging, surveillance systems, and computer vision.
